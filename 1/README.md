## Chaotic AUR
Chaotic AUR is a AUR repository, made for convenience of those people who don't like 
compiling programs from the AUR. The cool thing is that you don't need any AUR helper it. 
You can just **pacman**, or use **paru**, in conjuction the normal AUR. 

Setup Chaotic AUR following this website: [Chaotic AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx/)
