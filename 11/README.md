# Zathura

**Zathura** is a pdf viewer, which is

1. Minimal
2. Customizable with themes
3. Has vim keymaps

Because **Zathura** is minimal, it requires
you to install an extra package called
`zathura-pdf-mupdf`, to enable pdf support.
 
Config of **zathura** can be found in `~/.config/zathura/zathurarc`.
