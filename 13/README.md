## Waydroid

**WSA(Windows Subsytem for Android)** might not be an amazing
android emulator, but it has really good integration with
Windows. But talking about emulators in Linux, there aren't
many of them. **Waydroid** is a **WSA** alternative for Linux.
Advantages are:

1. Well integrated with Linux enviroment
2. Near native performance(?)
3. Full screen application support, without titlebars and borders
**etc**.
