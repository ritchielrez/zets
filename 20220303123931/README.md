## Fibonacci layout in I3WM

[Autotiling](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/autotiling) is a i3 extension(that's what I call), that uses `i3-ipc` library 
to manage windows, and tile them in **fibonacci spiral** layout like in BSPWM. You can install it in Arch by installing this
package called `autotiling`. Run this in startup, executable is called `autotiling`. And windows should be now spawning
in **fibonacci** layout.
