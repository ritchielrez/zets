# Ublock suddenly started letting some ads leak out

Never in my life I though `Ublock Origin` would break, better where we are.
I honestly thought `YouTube` had cracked it, the days of watching `YouTube` 
without any ads was long gone. But in reaility, I just had to go through
the following steps to fix the issue. Those are: 

- Go the dashboard of `Ublock Origin`
- Then, go to *Filter lists*
- CLick *Purge all caches*
- Then *Update now*

If you are still having this issue, you should then follow these steps:

- Go to Support pane
- Scroll down to Troubleshooting information section
- Copy/paste content here

Though often times just restarting your browser or reinstalling the extension should work too.
