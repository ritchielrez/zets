This is now my new note talking method. Simple yet effective, known as Zettelkasten. 
The cool thing is that with this method, you can take effective notes with digitally
but also with pen and paper. This is an age old method, of using slip of papers to 
take notes, then organize them in different files(not the digital one).  

This method is attributed to **Niklas Luhmann** who was a very prolific thinker and writer.
